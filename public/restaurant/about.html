    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>
        Since its foundation in 2007, Souper Douper has been a mainstay favorite for American and Canadian casual dining.
        Bridging the gap between upscale hotel dining rooms and at-home family dinner tables, Souper Douper has won over the hearts
        of diners of all ages in nearly all 50 states. Conceived by Preston and Britt Derby, the pair realized while traveling
        that there were no accessible and affordable dining locations where soups of all backgrounds could be found
        being served. Souper Douper prides itself on a consistent menu of favorite soups from all over the world alongside
        local favorites shown off by regional chefs at each location. With offerings for both take-out and dine-in experience,
        customers can enjoy a piping hot bowl of soup on the go or in our comfortable and beautiful dining spaces.
        With a constantly rotating menu, enjoy entirely made-from-scratch award winning soups such as our Chicken Noodle,
        Clam Chowder, Tomato Basil, Tom Kha, Vietnamese Pho, and African Peanut. We even offer numerous
        gluten-free and allergen conscientious options. Please feel free to ask your server for any info on ingredients, and
        they will be happy to provide you with complete and concise lists. Alongside soups, sandwiches and other American
        dining classics are served as well as our signature bread-rolls and salad with every meal. Whether grabbing something
        warm on the go or looking for somewhere fun for the entire family, Souper Douper is sure to scratch that fiendish
        urge for a good 'ol bowl of soup.
